	    <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <p>
		I’ve been a microbe nerd ever since my middle school science teacher gifted me a microscope.
		That moment sparked a lifelong curiosity about the invisible world. Take a look at my instagram @microbewave.</p>

		<p>
		I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences and I can honestly say;science never stops amazing me. From microbes to fabric, I’m always in awe of how this universe works.

	    <h2>Experience & Journey</h2>
	    <p>
		I've always been curious. Nothing "sparked" my love of science—it’s simply a part of how I engage with the world. Tools like my first microscope and experiences like managing arthritis didn’t create my curiosity; they just gave it direction. Even now, my interests remain broad: I find joy in learning languages, cooking, playing games, and exploring abstract topics like knot theory. Learning is what energizes me, and curiosity is essential to who I am.

		What grounds me most is connecting with people. Whether through hospital work,teaching, or meeting people on the street. I deeply value genuine conversations and the exchange of perspectives. Humans are living tapestries of stories and experiences, and I consider it a privilege to listen, learn, and share in that richness.

	    </p>
	    <p>
		I began volunteering in hospitals as early as high school—first at The Jewish Hospital and then at Cincinnati Children's. These early experiences in patient care laid a foundation of empathy and curiosity. During college, I deepened this interest with a clinical internship and a role as a <strong>medical scribe</strong>, documenting patient encounters in real-time across urgent care settings.Additionally, my diagnosis with juvenile arthritis opened more doors to science, science communication, and fueled my learning in general. That early experience taught me resilience and sparked my interest in understanding the science behind health. I later became a <strong>peer mentor</strong> through the Arthritis Foundation, where I supported teens facing similar challenges and was honored during the 2019 Walk to Cure Arthritis.

	    </p>

	    <p>
		In parallel, I pursued neuroscience research at <strong>Cincinnati Children's Hospital</strong>, working with animal models of brain injury. This project eventually led to a publication in <em>The Journal of Microglia</em> and gave me hands-on skills in immunohistochemistry and neuroanatomy.
	    </p>

	    <p>
		After earning my BSc in Neurobiology and completing a graduate certificate in data science, I joined a <strong>research lab in pharmaceutical sciences</strong>, where I bridged wet-lab and computational techniques. From analyzing SIDS-related gene expression to building machine learning models for HIV drug interactions, my work has always aimed to integrate multiple scientific languages into one conversation about better patient care.
	    </p>

	    <p>
		Today, I am a <strong>PhD Student in Pharmaceutical Sciences</strong> at the University of Cincinnati, and I’m honored to have been named a <strong>Presidential Fellow</strong>. I continue to explore the intersections of biology, pharmacology, and data science with the goal of creating safer, smarter therapies and empowering others through knowledge.

	    <h2>Research & Interests</h2>
	    <p>
		My research lies at the intersection of pharmacology, microbiology, and computational biology.
		I’m interested in drug mechanisms, microbiome interactions, and data-driven approaches
		to understanding disease and therapy.
